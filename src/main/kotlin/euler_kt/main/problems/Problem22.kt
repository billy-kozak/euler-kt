/**
 * Implement problem 22
 *
 * The output of this problem is based solely on the input file names.txt, but since we don't want to chance the
 * optimizer recognizing the function as pure no-args and optimizing to constant return, we'll add a dummy parameter
 * which we will multiply to each word score so that it can't be optimized.
 *
 * The alternative would be to make the names list an input parameter, but this is awkward to do given the current
 * architecture, mainly because of the JMH benchmark library. Furthermore, we don't want the resource I/O to become
 * part of the profile time, because it's likely to dominate the run time if we do so, and so we want to load it in
 * during class construction instead.

            Problem 22:
            Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
            first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each
            name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
            
            For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 =
            53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
            
            What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
