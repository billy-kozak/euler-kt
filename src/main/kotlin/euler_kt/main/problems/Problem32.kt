/**
 * Harness for Problem 32
 *
 * There's no obvious "key parameter" we can select to parameterize this solution, but we should try to pick one anyway
 * to aovoid any shenanigans with the JIT optimizer.
 *
 * So we'll 'modify' the problem slightly so that we only check for multiplicands and multipliers which, together,
 * have a length of 5 digits. Since the only possible pandigital products are 4 digits long, this doesn't actually
 * change the problem at all.
 *
 * We can prove that fact with some simple math.
 *
 * Running with any key param other than 5, still makes for a valid algorithm, but should always return 0.

            We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for 
            example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
            
            The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and 
            product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
            
            Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 
            9 pandigital.
            
            HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
